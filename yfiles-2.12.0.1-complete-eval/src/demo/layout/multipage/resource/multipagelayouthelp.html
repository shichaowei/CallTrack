 <h2>How Multi-Page Layout Works</h2>
 <p>
 MultiPageLayouter subdivides a large graph (called model graph) into a set of
 smaller graphs (called page graphs) such that the layout of each page graph
 fits a specified maximum page size.
 To guarantee that no information is lost when distributing the elements
 of the model over several pages, the algorithm introduces three kinds of
 auxiliary nodes.
 </p>
 <h3>Auxiliary Nodes</h3>
 <dl>
 <dt>Connectors</dt>
 <dd>
 <img src="type_connector.png" alt="Sample Connector Node"/>
 <br/>
 The layout algorithm replaces edges between nodes on different pages by
 so-called connector nodes.
 More precisely, for each edge between two nodes <code>v</code> and
 <code>w</code> that belong to different page graphs, there is a connector node
 attached to <code>v</code> that has the same label as node <code>w</code>.
 Similarly, there is a connector node attached to <code>w</code> that has the
 same label as node <code>v</code>.
 Clicking on a connector node will switch to the page graph that holds the
 related element.
 </dd>
 <dt>Proxies</dt>
 <dd>
 <img src="type_proxy.png" alt="Sample Proxy Node"/>
 <br/>
 The layout algorithm may also replicate a node as one or more proxy nodes, if
 the original node and its direct neighbors do not fit onto a single page.
 Proxy nodes have the same label as the node they replicate.
 Clicking on a proxy node will switch to the page graph that holds the replicated
 node.
 </dd>
 <dt>Proxy References</dt>
 <dd>
 <img src="type_proxy_reference.png" alt="Sample Proxy Reference Node"/>
 <br/>
 For each proxy node the layout algorithm creates a so-called proxy reference
 node in the page graph that holds the node which is replicated by the proxy.
 Proxy reference nodes are labeled with the number of the page graph that
 holds the referenced proxy node.
 Clicking on a proxy reference node will switch to the page graph that holds the
 referenced proxy node.
 </dd>
 </dl>
 <h2>Demo Features</h2>
 <p>
 After calculating a new layout for the given model graph (either a multi-page
 layout or a single-page layout, see <code>Single Page Layout</code> below),
 the first page graph is displayed in the central graph view.
 Using the arrow controls in the toolbar, it is possible to navigate
 through all created page graphs.
 </p>
 <p>
 The overview in the upper left corner displays all pages which are referenced
 from the current page graph.
 Clicking on a page in the overview will switch to the corresponding page graph.
 </p>
 <p>
 Below the overview is a searchable tree that displays (the labels of) the nodes
 in the model graph.
 Double-clicking on an item in the tree will switch to the page graph that holds
 the corresponding node.
 </p>
 <h3>Layout Settings</h3>
 <h3>General</h3>
 <dl>
   <dt>Page Layout</dt>
   <dd>
     Specifies the core layout algorithm that is used to lay out the single
     pages.
   </dd>
   <dt>Single Page Layout</dt>
   <dd>
     If this option is enabled, the graph is drawn onto a single page (the
     maximum page size is ignored).
   </dd>
   <dt>Grouping</dt>
   <dd>
     Specifies whether node grouping should
     (a) be ignored,
     (b) include only common nodes, or
     (c) also assign connector nodes to groups.
   </dd>
   <dt>Maximum Width</dt>
   <dd>Specifies the maximum width of a page.</dd>
   <dt>Maximum Height</dt>
   <dd>Specifies the maximum height of a page.</dd>
   <dt>Maximum Duration</dt>
   <dd>
     Specifies the preferred time limit (in seconds) for the layout algorithm.
     Note that restricting the maximum duration may result in a worse layout
     quality. Furthermore, the actual runtime may exceed the maximum duration
     since the layout algorithm still has to find a valid solution.
   </dd>
   <dt>Draw Page</dt>
   <dd>
     If this option is enabled, the specified maximum page size is visualized
     in the background of the current page graph.
   </dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>Connector Representation</h3>
 <p>
 Basically, if there are multiple edges between two nodes lying on different
 pages, a single pair of connector nodes is sufficient, i.e., multiple edges
 are attached to a single connector node. This behavior can be adjusted using
 the following properties:
 </p>
 <dl>
   <dt>Separate Types</dt>
   <dd>
     If this option is enabled, edges of different type are attached to
     different connector nodes. Two edges are of different type if they have
     either different line types, different line colors, or different
     source/target arrows.
   </dd>
   <dt>Separate Direction</dt>
   <dd>
     If this option is enabled, edge with different direction are attached to
     different connector nodes.
   </dd>
   <dt>Separate Multi-edges</dt>
   <dd>
     If this option is enabled, each edge is attached to a separate connector
     node.
   </dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>The File Menu</h3>
 <dl>
   <dt>Load Model Graph</dt>
   <dd>
     Loads a graph and calculates a new multi-page layout for loaded graph.
     The model graph's nodes are displayed in the searchable tree view on the
     left hand side.
   </dd>
   <dt>Save Model Graph</dt>
   <dd>
     Saves the current model graph.
   </dd>
   <dt>Save Page Graph</dt>
   <dd>
     Saves the page graph that is displayed in the central graph view.
   </dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>The Sample Graphs Menu</h3>
 <p>
   Each entry loads an example model graph and calculates a new
   multi-page layout.
 </p>
 <h3>The Sample Settings Menu</h3>
 <p>
   Each entry loads predefined layout settings to be used for the next
   multi-page layout calculation.
