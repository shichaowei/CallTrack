<h2>Help</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The ComponentLayouter arranges the connected components of a graph. This demo shows how the components can be
    arranged using different arrangement styles. The demo uses the size of the view as the preferred layout size.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
    Create a graph with different components or load one of the sample graphs. Choose an arrangement style and specify
    the spacing between the components. Change the graph by adding or removing nodes and edges and press "Layout" to
    rearrange the components.
</p>

<h3>Available Styles</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>Multiple Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        Tries to place components in multiple rows so that the overall aspect ratio of all components gets as close to
        the aspect ratio of the preferred layout size as possible.
    </dd>

    <dt>Single Row</dt>
    <dd>
        Places components next to each other in a single row.
    </dd>

    <dt>Single Column</dt>
    <dd>
        Places components above each other in a single column.
    </dd>

    <dt>Packed Rectangle</dt>
    <dd>
        Tries to place components like in a rectangular cloud around the biggest component.
    </dd>

    <dt>Compact Rectangle</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to <i>Packed Rectangle</i> but components might even be placed in empty spaces inside other components.
    </dd>

    <dt>Packed Circle</dt>
    <dd>
        Tries to place components like in a cloud around the biggest component.
    </dd>

    <dt>Compact Circle</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to <i>Packed Circle</i> but components might even be placed in empty spaces inside other components.
    </dd>

    <dt>Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        Places components in multiple rows. In contrast to <i>Multiple Rows</i>, each row may also be divided into
        further sub-rows. Thus especially being advantageous, if there are few very large components and many
        significantly smaller ones. The strategy tries to arrange the components such that the aspect ratio of the final
        component placement gets as close as possible to the aspect ratio of the preferred layout size.
    </dd>

    <dt>Compact Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to <i>Nested Rows</i> but this strategy tries not always to come as close to the preferred view ratio,
        if not necessary, i.e. if a ratio close to the preferred ratio only induces a lot of unused view space. This
        unused space will be minimized.
    </dd>

    <dt>Width Constrained Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        It uses the same core strategy as <i>Nested Rows</i>, but under the restriction that the resulting width does
        not exceed the preferred width.
    </dd>

    <dt>Height Constrained Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        It uses the same core strategy as <i>Nested Rows</i>, but under the restriction that the resulting height does
        not exceed the preferred width.
    </dd>

    <dt>Width Constrained Compact Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to <i>Width Constrained Nested Rows</i> but the result will be compacted, in order to minimize unused
        view space induced by components that are large in height.
    </dd>

    <dt>Height Constrained Compact Nested Rows</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to <i>Height Constrained Nested Rows</i> but the result will be compacted, in order to minimize unused
        view space induced by components that are large in width.
    </dd>
