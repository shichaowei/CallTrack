<h2>Graph Explorer Demo</h2>
<p>
For large graphs, it is often not feasible to display all elements to a user.
Therefore, strategies to filter and/or navigate the graph elements have to be
used. This demo shows how large graphs can be explored interactively.
</p>
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>
This demo works with two graphs: a (large) model graph and a (smaller) view
graph.
The model graph constitutes the complete set of available information.
The demo lists (the labels of) the model graph's  nodes in a searchable tree on
its left-hand side.
The view graph is a (small) excerpt of the model graph.
It is displayed in the central graph view.
</p>
<h3>How to Explore Graphs</h3>
<p>
Double-clicking on an item in the tree will add a corresponding node to the
displayed view graph. Nodes in the view are sometimes decorated with a small,
yellow icon in their upper right corner. The number given in the icon is the
number of nodes/edges that are connected to the corresponding node in the model
graph but are currently <b>not</b> displayed in the view. Double-clicking on
such a node in the view will add some or all of those nodes/edges, too.
</p>
<p>
By holding down <code>CTRL</code> while double-clicking on a node,
it is possible to reposition the node's neighbors instead of adding new
neighbors to the view.
</p>
<h3>The File Menu</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Load Model Graph</dt>
  <dd>
    Loads a graph as model graph. Supports graphs in GraphML (*.graphml) and
    compressed GraphML (*.graphmlz) format.
  </dd>
  <dt>Save Model Graph</dt>
  <dd>
    Saves the current model graph in either GraphML (*.graphml) or compressed
    GraphML (*.graphmlz) format.
  </dd>
  <dt>Save Filtered Graph</dt>
  <dd>
    Saves the view graph that is displayed in the central graph view in either
    GraphML (*.graphml) or compressed GraphML (*.graphmlz) format.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h3>The Sample Graphs Menu</h3>
<p>
Each entry loads an example model graph. All example graphs are loaded from
compressed GraphML (*.graphmlz) format.
</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Layout</dt>
  <dd>
  Specifies the layout strategy that is used to position elements.
  The button to the right of the combo box calculates a new layout for the
  visible graph.
  </dd>
  <dt>Explore Nodes</dt>
  <dd>
  Specifies the nodes that are added by exploration. Possible values are:
  <br/><span class="keyword">Predecessors</span>
  means all nodes that are reachable only by outgoing edges of a selected node.
  <br/><span class="keyword">Successors</span>
  means all nodes that are reachable only by ingoing edges of a selected node.
  <br/><span class="keyword">Neighbors</span>
  means all nodes that are reachable by ingoing and outgoing edges of a
  selected node.
  </dd>
  <dt>Max New Nodes on Click</dt>
  <dd>
  Specifies the maximum number of new nodes that are added by exploration.
  If the number of hidden neighbors of a node is larger than this value,
  adding all neighbors requires several double-clicks.
  </dd>
  <dt>Filter Neighbors</dt>
  <dd>
  If this option is enabled, exploration removes nodes if the length of the
  shortest path from a node to any selected node is greater than the value of
  <span class="keyword">Max Neighbor Distance</span>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Max Neighbor Distance</dt>
  <dd>
  If <span class="keyword">Filter Neighbors</span> is enabled, exploration
  removes nodes if the length of the shortest path from a node to any selected
  node is greater than the value of this option.
  </dd>
