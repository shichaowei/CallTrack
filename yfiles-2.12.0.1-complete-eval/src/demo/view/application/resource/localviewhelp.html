 <p>
 A local view displays a subset of a graph's elements. The intent is usually to
 improve performance, usability, or view experience in general (or all of the
 before mentioned).
 </p>
 <h2>Main Graph View</h2>
   <p>
   The display and editor area to the right. Several ways to interact with its
   graph are possible and may trigger an update of the local view (the display
   area to the left) depending on the chosen <em>update trigger</em> (see
   below).
   </p>

  <h3>Mouse Interaction</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Left Click on Node</dt>
    <dd>Selects the node.</dd>
    <dt>Left Mouse Drag on Canvas</dt>
    <dd>Selects multiple graph elements.</dd>
    <dt>Right Mouse Drag</dt>
    <dd>Moves the diagram within the view.</dd>
    <dt>Mouse Wheel</dt>
    <dd>Changes the zoom level of the view.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Key Bindings</h3>
	<dl>
    <dt>Left Arrow Key</dt>
    <dd>Selects a node to the left of the currently selected node</dd>
    <dt>Right Arrow Key</dt>
    <dd>Selects a node to the right of the currently selected node</dd>
    <dt>Up Arrow Key</dt>
    <dd>Selects a node above the currently selected node</dd>
    <dt>Down Arrow Key</dt>
    <dd>Selects a node below the currently selected node</dd>
	</dl>

 <h2>Local Graph View</h2>
   <p>
   The display area to the left.
   </p>

  <h3>Mouse Interaction</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Double Click on Node</dt>
    <dd>Selects and centers the node in the main view if possible.</dd>
    <dt>Double Click on Edge</dt>
    <dd>Selects and centers the edge in the main view if possible.</dd>
  </dl>

 <h2>Settings</h2>
 <p>
   The available settings govern when and how to update the local graph view.
 </p>

   <h3>Update Trigger</h3>
   <dl>
     <dt>Mouse Hover</dt>
     <dd>The local view is updated if the mouse hovers (for about 1/10 of a
         second) over a node or edge in the main graph view.
         The node or edge over which the mouse hovers is the single input
         element for the chosen update strategy (see below).</dd>
     <dt>Selection Change</dt>
     <dd>The local view is updated if the selection state of nodes or edges is
         changed in the main graph view changes.
         Either all selected nodes or all selected edges (as appropriate)
         are used as input elements for the chosen update strategy (see
         below).</dd>
   </dl>

   <h3>Node Strategies</h3>
   <p>
     Available strategies to create local views for input nodes.
     Clicking on the corresponding radio button will activate the strategy
     and possibly display additional settings.
   </p>
   <dl>
     <dt>Neighborhood</dt>
     <dd>Displays all nodes that are reachable by directed or undirected paths
         upto a specific length.
       <dl>
         <dt class="inner">Included Nodes</dt>
         <dd>
           Determines which nodes make up the neighborhood of the input
           nodes.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">Predecessors</span> means all nodes that are
           reachable by outgoing edges only.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">Successors</span> means all nodes that are
           reachable by ingoing edges only.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">Predecessors and Successors</span> means the
           union of the two aforementioned node sets.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">All Neighbors</span> means all nodes that are
           reachable by undirected edge paths.
         </dd>
         <dt class="inner">Maximum Graph Distance</dt>
         <dd>The maximum number of edges to traverse to reach a neighborhood
             node.</dd>
         <dt class="inner">Hierarchy Aware</dt>
         <dd>Determines whether the nodes real neighbors and all ancestor nodes
           are shown. </dd>
         <dt class="inner">Included Edges</dt>
         <dd>
           Determines the edges that are displayed in the local view.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">None</span> means no edges at all.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">Subgraph Edges</span> means all edges
           that connect any two of the displayed nodes.
           <br/>
           <span class="keyword">Shortest Paths</span> means the edges that lie
           on the shortest path from one of the input nodes to one of the other
           displayed nodes.
         </dd>
       </dl>
     </dd>
     <dt>Common Parent Group</dt>
     <dd>
       Displays all nodes that share the same parent group node as one of the
       input nodes and edges connecting only these nodes.
       <br/>
       <span class="keyword">Include Descendants</span> determines whether
       the contents of displayed group nodes should be displayed as well.
     </dd>
     <dt>Ancestor Groups</dt>
     <dd>
       Displays the input nodes and all of their ancestor group nodes.
       A group node is considered to be the ancestor of another node if it
       either contains the node itself or one of its ancestor nodes.
       <br/>
       <span class="keyword">Include Focus Nodes</span> determines whether
       the input nodes are displayed as well.
     </dd>
     <dt>Folder Contents</dt>
     <dd>
       Displays the contents or inner graphs of all input nodes that are
       folder nodes. The nodes labeled <em>y.util</em> and <em>y.util.pq</em>
       are the only folder nodes in the sample diagram that is displayed in
       the main graph view.
       <br/>
       <span class="keyword">Always Include Folders</span> means that for each
       input folder node a group node representative is created in the local
       view.
       <br/>
       <span class="keyword">Include Folders As Needed</span> means that a
       group node representative for input folder nodes is created if the
       contents of more than one folder are displayed.
       <br/>
       <span class="keyword">Never Include Folders</span> means that input
       folder nodes will not be displayed in the local view.
     </dd>
     <dt>Selected Subgraph</dt>

         nodes.</dd>
   </dl>

       the selection states of the <span class="keyword">Source</span> and
